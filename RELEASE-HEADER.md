## Installation

### Windows
Gimbal Ghost can be installed by downloading and running the `GimbalGhost.exe` asset below.

### Linux
Download `GimbalGhost.AppImage` and mark it as executable before running. This is a portable executable and will not be installed. For better system integration, consider setting up [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) if your distribution does not already provide it.

### MacOS
Gimbal Ghost can be installed by downloading, unzipping, and running the `Gimbal Ghost.app.zip` asset below. You can also copy the unzipped `Gimbal Ghost.app` to the Application folder. Gimbal Ghost is unsigned so you may need to remove the com.apple.quarantine attribute by running the following CLI command from the folder containing the app: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Gimbal\ Ghost.app`.

### Future Updates
Gimbal Ghost is automatically updated in the background. When opening the app it checks for updates and downloads them in the background. Updates are installed when you close the app. NOTE: The app will not open until the background installation is completed.
